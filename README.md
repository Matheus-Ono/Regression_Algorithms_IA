# Regression_Algorithms_IA

Machine Learning Project on Classifier Models.
To carry out the activity, I went through the following stages:<br/>
● Perform exploratory analysis and data preprocessing;<br/>
● Train and compare at least 4 different Machine Learning models;<br/>
● Compare the models using different performance metrics.<br/>
